# Ice Breaker (TypeScript Edition)

> This repository is a TypeScript rewrite of the original [ice_breaker](https://github.com/emarco177/ice_breaker) project. It‚Äôs a generative AI application that crawls LinkedIn & Twitter data about a person and customizes a friendly ‚Äúice breaker‚Äù message for them.

## Overview

Ice Breaker is a web application that:

- Crawls LinkedIn data using [Scrapin.io](https://www.scrapin.io/?utm_campaign=influencer&utm_source=github&utm_medium=social&utm_content=edenmarco) (paid service with free credits to start).
- Fetches Twitter data (via the paid Twitter API).
- Uses [LangChainü¶úüîó](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) to build conversational and generative AI features.
- Creates a personalized ‚Äúice breaker‚Äù message based on a person‚Äôs professional (LinkedIn) and social (Twitter) footprint.

This TypeScript edition provides the same functionality as the original Python-based app but uses Node.js/TypeScript for the backend.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js & TypeScript**: Core backend technology.
- **Express**: Web framework for handling routes.
- **Twitter API (v2)**: Paid API for fetching public user tweets.
- **Scrapin.io**: Paid LinkedIn crawling service.
- **LangChain**: Library for building AI workflows and language model applications.
- **dotenv**: Environment variable management.

> **Note**  
> This project uses **paid APIs** (Twitter, Scrapin.io). Make sure you have valid keys/tokens from these services.

## Environment Variables

You‚Äôll need the following environment variables set in a `.env` file for this project. An example file named [`.env.example`](.env.example) is provided:

```
PROXYCURL_API_KEY=your_proxycurl_api_key_here
TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token
TWITTER_API_KEY=your_twitter_api_key
TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET=your_twitter_api_key_secret
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
```

### Steps to Acquire API Keys

1. **Scrapin.io**

   - [Sign up](https://www.scrapin.io/) for a free trial or choose a paid plan.
   - Obtain your **API Key** from your Scrapin.io dashboard.
   - (This can be stored in `PROXYCURL_API_KEY` if you're using Proxycurl‚Äôs or a similar third-party aggregator‚Äîfollow your chosen service‚Äôs instructions.)

2. **Twitter API (v2)**

   - Go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/) and create a project/app.
   - Generate your **Bearer Token**, **API Key**, **API Secret Key**, **Access Token**, and **Access Token Secret** under the ‚ÄúKeys and tokens‚Äù tab.

3. **Add the keys** to your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   PROXYCURL_API_KEY=xxxxx
   TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN=xxxxx
   TWITTER_API_KEY=xxxxx
   TWITTER_API_KEY_SECRET=xxxxx
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=xxxxx
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=xxxxx
   ```

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 16+** (recommended LTS version or higher).
- **NPM or Yarn** installed globally.
- A **Twitter developer account** (with API credentials).
- A **Scrapin.io** (or similar aggregator) account and API key.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Orhan-Said/Ice_breaker.git
   cd ice_breaker_ts
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:

   - Copy the example file and fill in your keys:
     ```bash
     npm run copy-env
     # This will create a .env file from .env.example
     ```
   - Update `.env` with your actual credentials.

4. **Build and start the application**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

   Or run in **development mode**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open in your browser**:
   - The server typically runs at `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port you configure).

## Scripts

The following scripts are available in `package.json`:

- **`npm run build`**  
  Compiles TypeScript into JavaScript output in the `dist/` folder.

- **`npm run start`**  
  Starts the compiled application from the `dist/` folder.

- **`npm run dev`**  
  Runs the app in development mode, watching for file changes and automatically restarting via [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).

- **`npm run copy-env`**  
  Copies the `.env.example` file to `.env`. Useful for quickly bootstrapping your environment variables.
